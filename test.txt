In difference_update():  Only difference elements will be added.

Then why we need S3 sir? we can directly use s3=s1.difference_update(s2).  In real-time, is there any usecase for s3?

Can you please let us know any real time application/scenario where we would need using this method like s3=s1.difference_update(s2) when we know s3 returns None.

>>> print(f"product of a and b is: {round(a*b,2)}")
product of a and b is: 209.89


* Write a Python pgm which demonstrates the functionality of arithmetic operators.
* Write a python pgm which will calculate square root of a given number.

* which will calculate a to the power of m (a^m) where a is base and m is power
* write a python pgm which will calculate (a+b) whole square.  --> 2 logics
First logic:  (a+b)**2
Second logic: (a+b) * (a+b)
Third logic: a*a+2*a*b+b*b

Sir, in anyway can we restrict developers in using import * in the program or while executing the code? (because it consumes more memory)
or import * might lead to import some virus pgms into our systems, so how to restrict importing such modules?
